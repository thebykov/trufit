Create Access Levels for your users to manage capabilities and conditionally restrict content. Lightweight and powerful.

== Description ==

Restrict content and contexts to control what your users get exclusive access to, or drip content over time. Create an unlimited number of Access Levels and override user and role capabilities.

Use this plugin to quickly set up a membership site where your users can get different levels such as Gold, Silver and Bronze. Then, restrict access to e.g. posts tagged "Premium", articles written by specific authors, or all your free products.

No coding required.

####Unlimited Access Levels

* Multiple levels per user
* Synchronization with User Roles
* Set durations and let them expire
* Manage capabilities
* Redirect unauthorized users to a custom page
* Tease content for unauthorized users and show custom message 
* Shortcode to fine-tune restrictions in your posts or pages

####Unlimited Level Restrictions

* Nav menu items
* **[NEW]** Sidebars in [Content Aware Sidebars](http://dev.institute/wordpress/sidebars-pro/)

Conditionally restrict and drip content:

* Singulars, eg. posts or pages
* Custom Post Types
* Singulars with given taxonomies, eg. categories, tags or post formats
* Singulars by a given author
* Page Templates
* Post Type Archives
* Author Archives
* (Custom) Taxonomy Archives
* Date Archives
* Search Results
* 404 Not Found Page
* Front Page
* bbPress User Profiles
* BuddyPress Member Pages
* Languages (qTranslate, Polylang, Transposh, WPML)
* Pods Pages

Combine conditions in any way you like, e.g. restrict posts in Category X by author Y.

Negate conditions, e.g. restrict all pages except Page X.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the full plugin directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install the plugin through `Plugins` in the administration 
1. Activate the plugin through `Plugins` in the administration
1. Have fun creating your first Access Level under the menu *User Access > Access Levels > Add New*

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I restrict some content? =

1. Go to User Access > Access Levels > Add New
1. Click on the "Select content type" dropdown to add a condition
1. Click on the created input field and select the content you want to restrict.
1. To the right you can choose to sync the level with a User Role. All users with the selected role will then get this level. Otherwise, add the level to each user individually under the Members tab or in their profile
1. For unauthorized users, choose whether to redirect to another page or to show the content from another page along with a teaser/excerpt from the restricted content
1. Give your new level a descriptive title and save it

**Tips**
In order to restrict a context, e.g. "All Posts with Category X", simply select a new type of content from the dropdown below the **and** label and repeat Step 3.

You can choose to negate conditions, meaning that if you negate the group "All posts with Category X", the level will get exclusive access to all content but that

= How do I make an Access Level extend/inherit another level? =

Let us say you have two Access Levels, Gold and Silver. You want your users with the Gold level to be able to see content for the Silver level too.

1. Go to User Access > Access Levels > Edit the Gold level
1. To the right on this screen there is a Extend setting
1. Choose the Silver level as Extend and click Update

Your Gold level now inherits all the conditions from your Silver level. You can create as many hierarchical levels as you want, e.g. Bronze -> Silver -> Gold -> Platinum.

Capabilities are also inherited.

= I added a Level to a user, but it can still see other content? =

When you create an Access Level to restrict some content, only users with this level will be able to see that content, but they will also be able to see all other (unrestricted) content on your site.

A quick way to "lock down" and make sure e.g. only Administrators can see all content is to create a new Access Level for Administrators with a negated condition group containing "404 Page". This means that normal users only can see the 404 Page.

By default, Administrators will have access to all content regardless of your levels.

= Restricted content is still being displayed on archive pages or in widgets? =

Restrict User Access does currently not support hiding single items from archive pages, search results, widgets or custom lists.

It is recommended only to show titles and excerpts in these cases.
